Alice has always wanted a cat. Yesterday, she walked in a store and bought a cat home. This morning, the car disappeared.

Alice was so upset about losing the cat. She searched everywher for the cat until day had turned to night

One day while walking to class Alice saw her lost cat! She asked it why it left and it told her that it wanted to be with its family. While Alice was sad, she knew that her cat was happy with the place it was at currently.

Alice was still feeling down about not having a cat. She decided to check the library about summoning a cat from the spacial plane. She got into the spells and eventually she turned herself into a cat on accident!

She entered the cat's world and made her way to her cat's family. It was a great experience!
