Alice has always wanted a cat. Yesterday, she walked in a store and bought a cat home. This morning, the car disappeared.

Alice was so upset about losing the cat. She searched everywher for the cat until day had turned to night

One day while walking to class Alice saw her lost cat! She asked it why it left and it told her that it wanted to be with its family. While Alice was sad, she knew that her cat was happy with the place it was at currently.
